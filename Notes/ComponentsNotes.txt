Component:
    Components are independent and reusable bits of code.

Simple component:

React components implement a render() method that takes input data and returns what to display.
Input data that is passed into the component can be accessed by render() via this.props

Stateful component

-> In addition to taking input data , a component can maintain internal state data . 
-> When a component’s state data changes, the rendered markup will be updated by re-invoking render().


Functional component:

->A functional component is just a plain JavaScript function that returns JSX.
->Because a functional component is just a plain JavaScript function, you cannot use setState() in your component. 
  That’s the reason why they also get called functional stateless components.


Class component:

 -> A class component is a JavaScript class that extends React.Component.
 -> It must have the render() method returning JSX .
 -> Also known as Stateful components.
 -> React lifecycle methods can be used inside class components.
 -> These components are simple classes that are made up of multiple functions .
 -> Constructor are used as it needs to store state.

 ->The class component doesn’t have to explicitly pass props as an argument, it already has access to it.
